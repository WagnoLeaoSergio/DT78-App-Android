# Downgrade

+ Backup data with v3.4 or higher then uninstall
+ Install the [`Downgrade app`](https://github.com/fbiego/DT78-App-Android/raw/dev/resources/DT78-Downgrade-v1.0.apk) and restore the data
+ Update with your desired version (can be downloaded using the downgrade app)


This does not guarantee a successful downgrade as some versions may stop unexpectedly. 
In this case, it is recommended that you edit your restore file to include only steps and health data, again that does not guarantee a successful downgrade
